## Description

_Sometimes it's hard to keep track of your stylists at your beauty salon. But what if it wasn't so difficult? What if you could see who all works at
your salon?  Who the customers are?  Or which stylist the customer prefers to see? Whether owner, manager, secretary, or overstretched stylist handling multiple duties, this is for you. Add stylists. Update their name when they decide they would prefer to have their first name be Moonglow instead of Karen. Remove them after they decide to sail around the world the next seven years instead of working at your salon. Be jealous. But most of all, be organized and on top of your business. Less papercuts. More haircuts._
